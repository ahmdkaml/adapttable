### Patch Changes

- b77bcdc: Point each README's demo image at the live demo instead of a raw `.mp4` file,
  and deep-link it to that package's own adapter (`/demo/?kit=mui`,
  `?kit=radix`, …) now that the kit selector is URL-addressable. Clicking the
  image lands on a table you can actually use rather than a video download.
- b77bcdc: Fix RTL and popover defects found while filming the adapter demos.

  **Radix, right-to-left.** Three separate faults stacked: `dir` never reached
  the `<table>` (it stopped at the outer box), the ScrollArea that `Table.Root`
  wraps the table in writes its own `dir="ltr"` which outranked any inherited
  direction, and `justify` compiles to physical `rt-r-ta-left` / `rt-r-ta-right`
  classes rather than logical `start` / `end`. Under an Arabic locale the labels
  translated but the columns rendered left-to-right, and after the first two
  fixes every header and cell still hugged the left edge. All three are handled
  now; LTR is untouched.

  **Column menu ignored direction (Mantine, MUI, Radix, Base UI).** The menu
  portals to `<body>`, so it loses the table's direction unless it is passed
  explicitly — only Chakra did. Under RTL the grip and pin controls stayed on
  the wrong sides. Every adapter now forwards `dir` to its portalled menu.

  **Filter popover jumped over the trigger (Radix, Base UI).** Choosing the
  "between" operator reveals a second bound input, and the default collision
  handling answered that growth by flipping the whole panel above the trigger,
  covering the page header and the control just clicked. The panel now stays
  anchored below and scrolls if it runs out of room.

  **Ant Design column menu rendered a card inside a card.** The menu repainted
  the elevated surface antd's Popover already provides; only spacing belongs to
  the adapter now.

  **Ant Design mobile cards re-rendered on every keystroke.** Each card compared
  the shared editing bundle, whose identity changes whenever any draft changes,
  so typing in one cell re-rendered every card on screen and the per-row digest
  that exists to prevent exactly that was dead weight. Cards are now memoized on
  their visual inputs plus that digest, matching every other adapter.

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e36b3ee: Add an opt-in `exportCsv` toolbar button on every adapter. Exports the visible columns in display order for the current page (or the full filtered set with `scope: "all"`). New `exportCsv` label key in core defaults and all i18n locales.
- c402908: Add opt-in inline cell editing. Pass `onCellEdit` to enable; mark columns with `editable` / `editor` / `editValue`. Kit-native text, number, and select editors on every adapter (desktop + mobile). New `editCell` label in core defaults and all i18n locales. Without `onCellEdit`, editing stays fully dormant.
- 4546dcd: Add opt-in single-level row grouping. Pass `groupBy` to group by one column (frontend tier only; server sources devWarn and ignore). Optional `groupAggregates` shares the `summaryRow` mapper signature for per-group subtotals. Expand/collapse group headers on every adapter (desktop + mobile), with tri-state group selection when checkboxes are on. New `expandGroup`, `collapseGroup`, and `groupCount` labels in core defaults and all i18n locales. Without `groupBy`, grouping stays fully dormant.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies [c402908]
- Updated dependencies [4546dcd]
  - @adapttable/core@1.2.0

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- e909bf7: Refresh adapter npm README demos: animated GIFs (click through to mp4) replace static posters so npm package pages show motion without leaving the page.
- e909bf7: Fix portaled Filters/Columns/Drawer chrome: CSS tokens now apply on portal surfaces so overlays stay opaque above sticky headers, and multi-select chips / selects / drawer title render as real controls.

  Put overlay z-index tokens on Base UI **positioners** too — `transform` on the positioner is the stacking context, so z-index on the inner popup alone still lost to sticky table headers.

  Render multi-select filter options as label-only chips (no nested checkbox boxes).

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- ba0d42b: Add `@adapttable/base-ui` — a batteries-included Base UI (`@base-ui/react`) adapter with the same DataTable API as the other kits. The CLI detects `@base-ui/react` and scaffolds this adapter.
