## 1.2.2

### Patch Changes

- feed13d: Fix the broken hero image on every npm package page, and add a clip per feature.

  npm renders README images through GitHub's camo proxy, which refuses anything
  over 5 MB. Every demo GIF was 5.2–8.7 MB, so camo returned `Content length
exceeded` and each package page showed a broken image instead of the table.

  The clips are now cut per feature — row grouping, cell editing, filtering,
  column management and RTL — cropped to the table at native resolution rather
  than downscaling the whole page. Each is 232 KB–2.3 MB, and each is sharper
  than the 8 MB version it replaces, because a shorter clip spends its budget on
  pixels instead of length.

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- b77bcdc: Point each README's demo image at the live demo instead of a raw `.mp4` file,
  and deep-link it to that package's own adapter (`/demo/?kit=mui`,
  `?kit=radix`, …) now that the kit selector is URL-addressable. Clicking the
  image lands on a table you can actually use rather than a video download.
- a719db6: List inline cell editing and row grouping in each README's feature links. Both
  shipped in 1.2.0 but the package pages never mentioned them, so anyone reading
  on npm had no way to learn they exist.

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- e36b3ee: Add an opt-in `exportCsv` toolbar button on every adapter. Exports the visible columns in display order for the current page (or the full filtered set with `scope: "all"`). New `exportCsv` label key in core defaults and all i18n locales.
- c402908: Add opt-in inline cell editing. Pass `onCellEdit` to enable; mark columns with `editable` / `editor` / `editValue`. Kit-native text, number, and select editors on every adapter (desktop + mobile). New `editCell` label in core defaults and all i18n locales. Without `onCellEdit`, editing stays fully dormant.
- 4546dcd: Add opt-in single-level row grouping. Pass `groupBy` to group by one column (frontend tier only; server sources devWarn and ignore). Optional `groupAggregates` shares the `summaryRow` mapper signature for per-group subtotals. Expand/collapse group headers on every adapter (desktop + mobile), with tri-state group selection when checkboxes are on. New `expandGroup`, `collapseGroup`, and `groupCount` labels in core defaults and all i18n locales. Without `groupBy`, grouping stays fully dormant.

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- e909bf7: Refresh adapter npm README demos: animated GIFs (click through to mp4) replace static posters so npm package pages show motion without leaving the page.

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- 6c7030b: Bring the whole adapter set to feature parity.

  - **Entrance animation on every adapter.** The opt-in `animate` mount stagger —
    a dependency-free row/card entrance that honours `prefers-reduced-motion` —
    now works on MUI, Chakra, Ant Design, Radix, shadcn/ui and unstyled, not just
    Mantine. `useMountStagger` moved into `@adapttable/core`; the existing
    `@adapttable/mantine` import path is unchanged.
  - **Ant Design mobile-card windowing.** antd already virtualized desktop rows
    through its native table; under `virtualize` its mobile card list now windows
    through the shared engine as well, like every other adapter.
  - **Popover keyboard a11y fix (MUI, Chakra, Ant Design).** Pressing Escape in
    the filter popover now hands focus back to the Filters trigger instead of
    stranding keyboard users, matching the Mantine/Radix/unstyled behaviour and
    the documented overlay contract.
  - Docs and README polish: the `ColumnDef` `filter` JSDoc is attached to the
    right field, and each package README gains a "Try in StackBlitz" link (with
    migration guides where a source library exists); the Chakra README now
    correctly targets v3.

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- a94745e: AdaptTable 1.0 — the public API is now stable under semantic versioning.

  This release freezes the committed-stable surface: the `@adapttable/core` engine
  (source builders, `useDataTable` and its prop-getters, the core types, and the
  URL-state hooks), every adapter's `<DataTable>` props and extension points
  (`slots`, `classNames`, `toolbar`, `confirm`), and the `@adapttable/i18n` locale
  presets. From this release on, breaking changes to that surface ship only in a
  major version. There are no runtime behavior changes — this marks the stability
  commitment. `@adapttable/cli` is a scaffolding tool and keeps its own cadence.

### Patch Changes

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 682d3b7: Road-to-1.0 prep: document the versioning & stability contract, mark the
  `mergeProps`/`Props` prop-getter plumbing as `@internal` (consumers use the
  `useDataTable` prop-getters, not the merge helper), add a `smoke-dist`
  post-build check that asserts every advertised `exports`/`main`/`module`/`types`
  target is actually emitted, and harden `getPath`/`humanizeKey` to tolerate an
  empty/undefined key so a transiently-malformed column key can never crash a
  render. No behaviour changes; no breaking changes.

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- 6ab1391: docs: every package README now leads with a click-to-play demo — a poster (with
  a play button) that links to an mp4 of the table in action — replacing the
  autoplaying GIF. Republishing so the new READMEs land on npm.
- Updated dependencies [6ab1391]
  - @adapttable/unstyled@0.3.1

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a90a2c2: Logical column pinning, so pinning stays correct under RTL.

  **Breaking.** Pinned-side values are now `"start"` / `"end"` (were `"left"` /
  `"right"`) — this is the public `pinned` layout value and the `colPin` URL token
  (e.g. `colPin=name:start`); pre-existing `left`/`right` URLs no longer parse. The
  label keys `pinLeft` / `pinRight` / `moveLeft` / `moveRight` are renamed to
  `pinStart` / `pinEnd` / `moveStart` / `moveEnd`, with logical display strings
  shipped for every locale. Pinning a data column is now a start-only toggle; the
  injected actions column keeps its one-click end-pin.

  To migrate: update any `defaultColumnLayout={{ pinned: { x: "left" } }}` to
  `"start"` (and `"right"` → `"end"`), any persisted `colPin` URLs, and any custom
  `labels` overriding the renamed keys.

- a90a2c2: Numbered page buttons in every adapter's pagination (with first/last and
  ellipsis truncation), replacing the prev/next-only control — driven by a shared
  `paginationItems` builder in `@adapttable/core`.

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- c90b4ae: Add **`@adapttable/shadcn`** — a shadcn/ui adapter that gives a fully-styled AdaptTable in a single import (`import { DataTable } from "@adapttable/shadcn"`). It wraps `@adapttable/unstyled` with the shadcn class preset applied by default; pass your own `classNames` to override any part, or import the raw `shadcnClassNames` map directly. Requires shadcn/ui (its CSS variables + Tailwind config) in your app.
