Depend on sibling packages by caret range instead of an exact pin.

Adapters declared `workspace:*`, which publishes as an exact version — `@adapttable/mantine@1.2.2` required precisely `@adapttable/core@1.2.2`. Installing an adapter alongside `@adapttable/core` therefore produced **two copies of core**:

```
node_modules/@adapttable/core                                  1.2.2
node_modules/@adapttable/mantine/node_modules/@adapttable/core 1.2.1
```

Most of core is per-instance state, so a second copy is mainly waste — but the URL-namespace registry is module-level, so two copies means two registries, and two tables that do not set an explicit `urlKey` can claim the same namespace and overwrite each other's URL state.

The exact pin also forced all eight adapters to republish on every core patch, even when nothing about them changed.

`workspace:^` publishes as `^1.2.2`: the resolver keeps one copy, and a future core patch releases core alone. This release ships that range into every adapter, which is why all of them are included here — it is the last time a core change requires them.
